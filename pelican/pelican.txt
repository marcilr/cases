Pelican makes perhaps the best waterproof cases.  I own several of various sizes.
One for the gps and various sizes for backpacking trips.

=============================
Put the spare latch, spare latch pin, and pin that came out into the caving box
in the garage.  Left in the padded Pelican shipping envelope that they had arrived
in.  Made sense to store in a safe relevant location.

=============================
o Only the lid of the yellow Pelican had a foam liner.  I cut up the old blue 
  but pad into 5 pieces to line the case.  Worked very well to protect the 
  GoPro and such going into the case.

o The Instructions for Latch Replacement pdf I got from Pelican looks really nice.
  It shows the use of a pin punch to remove the pin.   However, the end of the pin
  where I would use the punch is covered by plastic and not that accessible.

  I got hold of the pin with a pair of vise grips that I hit with the Gullwing
  hammer.  The pin came out with moderate force.  I scarred the plastic underneath
  the pin a little bit with the vise grips.  Put in the new latch/ping with a punch
  and gullwing hammer.  The new latch looks fine.  Happy with the job.

o Called Pelican at (800)473-5422 to determine how to remove the pin from the
  yellow Pelican 1300 case.  Quick explanation is I just need to use more force.
  They are going to send email to marcilr@gmail.com with instructions on how
  to install replacement latch.

=============================
A pair of matching Pelican latches and latch pins arrived for the yellow 1300 case via
UPS Ground.   Very nice.

Part Number    Description              Quantity       Weight
--------------------------------------------------------------
1403-942-240   LATCH-ASY, 1.0, YELLOW      2 EA        0.002LB
1203-341-000   PIN-LATCH, STANDARRD        2 EA        0.010LB

The pins have a couple millimeters of threads on one end.  That said I don't think they are 
meant to me rotated.  I think the threads are only for pin retention.

=============================
Called Pelican at (800)473-5422 to replace the missing clip on the yellow 1300 case I 
had purchased at REI for $68.00

Confirmation number: 1210875

They will send some replacement latches.  Do *not* need to send the case back.
Awesome!

=============================
Bought a new Pelican 1300 case at REI for $68.00.  This case is for the Sharp camera
Shena's parents gave her on her birthday on Thursday.  Needed a stout case for trips.
