  Instructions for Latch Replacement
  Called Pelican at (800)473-5422 to determine how to remove the pin from the
  yellow Pelican 1300 case.  They send email to marcilr@gmail.com with
  this document with instructions for latch replacement.  Recommends use of
  1/16 pin punch to remove the pin.  The end of the pin I would hit with
  the pin punch is covered by plastic so there is still a little figuring.
